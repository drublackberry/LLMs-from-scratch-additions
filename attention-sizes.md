# In this book, when it is explaining causal attention, can you give me a good guide of the sizes of the matrices at each step of the implementation. For example, what is the size of the W\_q matrix and what is the size of Z (the context matrix)?

Based on the information from transformer implementations and the matrix dimensions typically used in causal attention, I'll provide you with a comprehensive guide to the matrix sizes at each step of the causal attention implementation.

# Matrix Dimensions Guide for Causal Attention Implementation

Let me walk you through the sizes of each matrix at every step, using common notation and dimensions.

## Key Parameters

First, let's establish our key dimensions:

- **N** = sequence length (number of tokens)
- **d** = model dimension (embedding dimension)
- **d_k** = key/query dimension
- **d_v** = value dimension

In many implementations (like the original Transformer), **d_k = d_v = d/h** where **h** is the number of attention heads. For single-head attention, often **d_k = d_v = d**.

## Step-by-Step Matrix Dimensions

### 1. Weight Matrices (Learnable Parameters)

**W_q (Query weight matrix)**: `[d × d_k]`
**W_k (Key weight matrix)**: `[d × d_k]`
**W_v (Value weight matrix)**: `[d × d_v]`

These are the trainable parameters that transform the input embeddings.[^1][^2]

### 2. Input and Intermediate Matrices

**X (Input embeddings)**: `[N × d]`

- Where N is your sequence length and d is the embedding dimension

**Q (Queries)**: `[N × d_k]`

- Calculated as: Q = X @ W_q

**K (Keys)**: `[N × d_k]`

- Calculated as: K = X @ W_k

**V (Values)**: `[N × d_v]`

- Calculated as: V = X @ W_v


### 3. Attention Score Computation

**Attention Scores (before masking)**: `[N × N]`

- Calculated as: scores = Q @ K^T
- Each element (i,j) represents how much token i should attend to token j[^2]

**Causal Mask**: `[N × N]`

- Upper triangular matrix filled with -inf (or very large negative values)
- Applied to prevent attending to future tokens

**Masked Scores**: `[N × N]`

- Same size as attention scores, but with future positions masked


### 4. Final Computation Steps

**Attention Weights (after softmax)**: `[N × N]`

- Calculated as: weights = softmax(masked_scores / √d_k)
- Each row sums to 1.0

**Z (Context Matrix/Output)**: `[N × d_v]`

- Calculated as: Z = attention_weights @ V
- This is your final output from the attention mechanism[^3]


## Concrete Example

Let's say you have:

- Sequence length N = 6 tokens
- Model dimension d = 512
- Single attention head with d_k = d_v = 512

Your matrices would be:

- **W_q, W_k, W_v**: `[512 × 512]` each
- **X**: `[6 × 512]`
- **Q, K**: `[6 × 512]` each
- **V**: `[6 × 512]`
- **Attention scores**: `[6 × 6]`
- **Causal mask**: `[6 × 6]` (upper triangular with -inf)
- **Attention weights**: `[6 × 6]`
- **Z (context matrix)**: `[6 × 512]`


## Multi-Head Attention Variation

If you're using multi-head attention with h heads:

- **d_k = d_v = d/h**
- Each head has its own W_q, W_k, W_v of size `[d × d/h]`
- Each head produces a context matrix of size `[N × d/h]`
- All heads are concatenated to form the final output of size `[N × d]`

The **context matrix Z** is particularly important because it contains the weighted combination of all value vectors, where the weights come from the causal attention mechanism that only allows looking at previous and current tokens.[^3]

This step-by-step breakdown should help you track exactly how the dimensions flow through your causal attention implementation!
